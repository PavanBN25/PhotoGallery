# PhotoGallery

Hi All,

This is a simple project of photo gallery. I have used php, html, javascript and css to complete this project.
In this project thumbnail images are present on left side of the screen, on clicking thumbnail image the image is shown in 
the picture frame at the center of the screen. To the right is a small box which gives 3 photo galleries. We can choose any of the 
photo galleries to veiw the images in them.


https://simplephotogallery.herokuapp.com/ is the link to which you can access the app. 


Thank you !!
